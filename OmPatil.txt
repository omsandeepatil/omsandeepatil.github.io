My Name is <span id="k">Om Patil</span>. <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

the human embodiment of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I'm Om Patil, your friendly neighborhood tech whisperer and software sorcerer. By day, I'm a code conjurer, and by night, I'm the hero Gotham deserves (as long as Gotham needs Python scripts and Java beans).</p>

<p>My love affair with technology started when I realized that pressing random buttons on the keyboard wasn't a viable career path. Since then, I've upgraded from smashing keys to writing code that I don't even sometimes understood</p>

<p>My superpowers include debugging code faster than a cat meme goes viral and googling error messages like a boss. I'm so good at troubleshooting that even my plants turn to me for tech support when they're feeling a bit wilted.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy turning caffeine into code, you can find me engaging in extreme sports like live-coding without a safety net or trying to explain the cloud to my grandparents. Spoiler alert: They still think it's an actual cloud.</p>

<p>I believe in pushing boundaries, but not too hardâ€”I once broke a keyboard, and that's as rebellious as I get. My spirit animal is a rubber duck, the unsung hero of debugging sessions, and my dream is to one day have my own Wikipedia page that's longer than the README file of my favorite open-source project.</p>

<p>So, buckle up, fellow techies, as I embark on this wild journey through lines of code, circuit boards, and a questionable amount of coffee. If you see someone muttering to their computer screen about semicolons and brackets, it's probably just me. Remember, I'm not antisocial; I'm just buffering. </p>
